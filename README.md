# Ballistic Missile Intercept Model

The goal of this project is to simulate a hit-to-kill ballistic missile intercept in Google Earth.

The plan is to start by developing a simplified model and then to build on that model over time. The first model iteration
does not take into account any of the following (for either the ballistic or interceptor missiles):

- Aerodynamic drag
- Propulsive thrust
- Changes in mass (e.g., after burning fuel)
- Earth's rotation
