- Allow users to specify velocity of ballistic missiles and intercptors
- Make it easy for users to input launch time in correct format
- Ballistic missile trajectory should be red when out of range of interceptors and green after coming within range
- Allow for random grouping of launchpoints and aimpoints (uncertainty in both)
- Allow for zone defense--number of interceptors, pick up rockets as they are incoming
- Allow for multiple attempts (and failures) to intercept a missile
- Account for if interceptor missile is not traveling fast enough/cannot be launched early enough to intercept missile
- Merge all KMLs for a single simulation into one file
- Sort out the issue with the bearing flipping at the final timestep
- Add range KML polygon (red/green)
- Add explosion (from Blender) at intercept points
- Add line from intercept point to ground to show debris field?
- Show model break-up (warhead breaking off from boosters with different blender objects)

#TODO: add function to calculate remaining distance to target from current position
#TODO: merge? set_launchpoint_bearing method with "compute_current_bearing" (or have one calculate and one set)

"currently assumes that you know the following parameters:
Target location
Fuel burn rate...

Future iterations of this model will relax this requirements, and incorporate probabilistic modeling..."
